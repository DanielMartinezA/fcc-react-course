# üìòÔ∏è Learn React Course

This repository showcases my solutions and project implementations for the [Learn React course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) from [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/). The course provided a comprehensive introduction to React and allowed me to strengthen my skills through interactive coding challenges and the development of eight fun projects.

## Course Overview

The **Learn React** course is an excellent resource for React beginners, providing a solid foundation in modern React development. Throughout the course, I worked on 140+ interactive coding challenges and built eight projects that cover a wide range of React concepts and techniques.

The course is divided into four modules, each focusing on building different projects while exploring specific topics:

1. **Build a React info site:** I learned the basics of React by creating an informational website using components, JSX, and state management.
2. **Build an AirBnb Experiences clone:** I dove deeper into React by building a basic static clone of the AirBnb Experiences website.
3. **Build a meme generator:** I learned how to manipulate and generate memes using React components and external APIs.
4. **Build a notes app and Tenzies game:** I further enhanced my React skills by creating a notes application with CRUD functionality and building the Tenzies dice game.
